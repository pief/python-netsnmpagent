WHAT IS IT?

python-netsnmpagent is a Python module that facilitates writing Net-SNMP
subagents in Python. Subagents connect to a locally running Master agent
(snmpd) over a Unix domain socket (eg. "/var/run/agentx/master") and using the
AgentX protocol (RFC2747). They implement custom Management Information Base
(MIB) modules that extend the local node's MIB tree. Usually, this requires
writing of a MIB as well, ie. a text file that specifies the structure, names
and data types of the information within the MIB module.

python-netsnmpagent was written after a lot of frustration trying to fix the
python-agentx module hosted on Sourceforge. I fixed some smaller issues there
but when it came to making sure that you could actually walk the whole MIB, not
just the variables registered, I realized that it would not make much sense to
reimplement the complete behavior of a proper SNMP agent when the NetSNMP API
actually can handle those things for you. Also, to be honest, I don't get
python-agentx's design :-)

python-netsnmpagent, by contrast, in the first line focusses on making the
net-snmp C agent API accessible from Python. Though I will try not to just
pass through every library call 1:1 but wrap them in a useful manner.

net-snmp itself also comes with a Python module (see the "python" subdirectory
in the source distribution), however those seem to be bindings that implement
the client side only, not the agent side only.


REQUIREMENTS

python-netsnmpagent requires the net-snmp libraries to be installed,
libnetsnmpagent to be precisely. Development files are not necessary.

In addition, the locally running snmpd instance must have been configured to
allow access by subagents through the AgentX protocol (see "EXAMPLE USAGE"
below).


DOWNLOAD

There is neither a homepage nor packacges for your favorite Linux/BSD/Unix
flavor yet. For now, you'll have to clone the repository on GitHub:

  git clone https://github.com/pief/python-netsnmpagent.git


INSTALLATION

There is no installation mechanism yet. Currently you would copy netsnmpagent.py
to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ or a similar path based on your
local Python installation. However, if you just want to try out the module
you don't need to copy anything anywhere, just see "EXAMPLE USAGE" below.


EXAMPLE USAGE

There is a well-commented example subagent included, example.py, together with
an example MIB, surprisingly named EXAMPLE-MIB.txt. Here's some step-by-step
instructions:

1. Make sure net-snmp is installed, snmpd in particular.

2. Make sure snmpd has been configured. Your /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf (path may
   vary) should contain lines similar to the following:
   
     # Required to allow subagents to connect to snmpd via AgentX protocol
     master agentx
   
     # Required for read-only access from localhost
     rocommunity public 127.0.0.1
   
     # Required for read-write access from localhost
     rwcommunity <yoursecret> 127.0.0.1
     
   For SNMP versions 1 and 2c (which are basically those I care about for now),
   replace "<yoursecret>" with a secret not too obvious, since it is the only
   protection against unauthorized write access, safe for the localhost access
   restriction.

3. Start snmpd with "/etc/init.d/snmpd start" or whatever your Linux/BSD/Unix
   dialect uses to start services.

4. Open two consoles/terminal sessions. Within both cd to the
   python-netsnmpagent directory. 

5. In the first console window we run the example subagent. Because connecting
   to snmpd's AgentX socket requires root rights, we use sudo:
   
     $ sudo python example.py 
     username's password:
     NET-SNMP version 5.7.1 AgentX subagent connected
     Serving SNMP requests, press ^C to terminate...

6. In the second console window we run the net-snmp command line utilities to
   examine the result:
   
     $ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public -M+. localhost EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleMIB
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleUnsigned = Gauge32: 0
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleUnsignedRO = Gauge32: 0
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleInteger = INTEGER: 0
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleIntegerRO = INTEGER: 0
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleCounter = Counter32: 240
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleTimeTicks = Timeticks: (79) 0:00:00.7
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleString = STRING: Test string

   The "-v" option selects version 2c of the SNMP protocol, "-c" specifies the
   community to use (remember that we configured a read-only "public" community
   in the snmpd configuration in step 2).
   
   The "-M" option allows to modify the search path for referenced MIBs. Since
   we reference EXAMPLE-MIB in the last argument and we have not copied
   EXAMPLE-MIB.txt to the system's MIBs directory /usr/share/snmp/mibs, we
   extend (the plus sign "+") the search path with the current directory (the
   dot character ".").

   EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleMIB references the root node in the EXAMPLE-MIB. If you
   haven't looked at the MIB yet, you should probably do so now.
   
7. Let's try modifying the values via SNMP:

     $ snmpset -v 2c -c <yoursecret> -M+. localhost \
       EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleInteger i -1
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleInteger = INTEGER: -1
     $ snmpset -v 2c -c <yoursecret> -M+. localhost \
       EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleUnsigned u -1
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleUnsigned = Gauge32: 4294967295
     $ snmpset -v 2c -c <yoursecret> -M+. localhost \
       EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleString s "Hello"
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleString = STRING: Hello
     $ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public -M+. localhost EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleMIB
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleUnsigned = Gauge32: 4294967295
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleUnsignedRO = Gauge32: 0
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleInteger = INTEGER: -1
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleIntegerRO = INTEGER: 0
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleCounter = Counter32: 319
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleTimeTicks = Timeticks: (324) 0:00:03.24
     EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleString = STRING: Hello

   Note that we used the read/write community string here we configured in step
   2. Also note the difference between SNMP's Integer32 and Unsigned32 datatypes
   illustrated when setting a value of "-1" (Gauge32 is the same as Unsigned32).


API

Admittedly the API for writing your own subagents in Python is nowhere next to
stable yet. For now, please see the example.py source code for info on how to
use the python-netsnmpagent module, but notice that this may change at any
time. You might want to follow development on the GitHub repo:

  https://github.com/pief/python-netsnmpagent.git


TODO

- wrap ctypes variables so that Python code does not have to know about ctypes
- implement table support
- stabilize API?
